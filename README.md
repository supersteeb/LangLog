LangLog

An extension of my "LearnChinese" app with a test. 


## User Stories

### Features:

* [x] User log in â€” devise (admin, sessions, etc)
* [x] Can create new word
* [x] Tracks how many words are added per day
* [x] Test that randomly generates questions (based on test-type)

Log:
- Don't use scaffold - better to customize. When destroying scaffold, destroy table first, then destroy scaffold
- playing with jsonb to store hash or array in table column

Problems
- Nov 5 upon logging out still shows words. should take to new session 

### Desired Features:
- As more tests are taken, the number of times a word is tested, determines its 'weight.' Higher 'weight' means less likely to be tested in the future (meaning it is more committed to memory). But specific to the type of test. 
- can separate by language
